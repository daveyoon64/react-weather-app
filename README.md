This app takes city and country input from the user, calls the OpenWeather API, and then 
renders the information for the user. This app will become more useful as I learn more 
about what React v16 can do.

## Tools and Frameworks Used
Visual Code
Bootstrap
React 16.3.2

## Requirements
npm version 4.3+

## How to run the app
1. Git clone this repository
2. npi i
3. npm start

## Next Steps
| 1. Limit input to 30 characters |
| 2. Input: Deal with 404 Error |
| 3. Deal with no city input |
| 4. Deal with no country input |
| 5. Localize states as much as possible |
